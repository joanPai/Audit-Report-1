This is my first audit report ever done. 
I learned via https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUWmJ86X_do&t=15366s . 
A course developed by Patrick Collins on smart contract audits & security.
The course provided a basic understanding of auditing practices, common vulnerabilities, and tools like MythX and Slither for security checks. 
I applied this knowledge to perform the audit and create this report.
